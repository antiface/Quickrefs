### ABSTRACT
* The main idea here is to look at a sample of simple note-taking apps for the command line written in Python;
* That is, we will be looking at THE NOTE-TAKING GENRE OF APPLICATION and also at PYTHONIC PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS;
* First, we will start with a list of the apps that we will be looking at. Afterwards, as we go through them, we will be taking notes on note-taking apps in Pythonic idioms.
