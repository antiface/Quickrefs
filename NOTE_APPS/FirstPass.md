### FIRST PASS - SIMPLEST OF THE LOT
* We will begin by looking at 20 of the simplest command-line note-taking apps in Python from our original list;
* We are beginning with the simplest because our plan is to go through them one by one and "critique" them, if you will;
* We want to look at paradigms, at idioms, and at (personal) style in code-writing;
* Readability and use of comments + documentation will be taken into account;
* First we introduce the list of 20 Simplest Note-Taking Apps in the Python language (taken from Github repositories).
